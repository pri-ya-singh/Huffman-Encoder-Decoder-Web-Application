This project focuses on the design and implementation of a Huffman Encoding and Decoding system using web technologies to demonstrate efficient data compression techniques. Huffman coding is a lossless compression algorithm that assigns variable-length binary codes to characters based on their frequency of occurrence, ensuring that more frequent characters use shorter codes and less frequent characters use longer ones. In this implementation, the system reads a text file, constructs a frequency map, builds a Huffman tree using a priority queue approach, and generates unique prefix codes for each character. The encoded data is stored in a custom binary file format that includes metadata such as frequency information and actual bit length to handle padding accurately. The decoding process reconstructs the Huffman tree from the stored metadata and successfully restores the original text without any data loss. Additionally, the project features a user-friendly interface that displays compression statistics such as original size, compressed size, and compression percentage. A visual representation of the Huffman tree is also provided using an HTML canvas, allowing users to better understand the encoding process. Overall, this project effectively combines algorithmic concepts with practical implementation and visualization, making it suitable for academic demonstration and real-world learning applications.
